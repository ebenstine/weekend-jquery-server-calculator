## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

What we did in this assignment:

1. Open all the necessary files to get our local server and client in communication with each other, and install all necessary items to help our server do its work efficiently.  
2.  Establish accurate file sourcing and set up our client side files as we normally would.
3.  Create buttons in our index file that JQuery will activate to be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and to find the result of those equations.
4. Create operator functions that assigns values to the necessary operator symbols, so that they can later be made functional with jQuery.
5. Establish the logic for the math equations in the server.  Once a calculation is complete, send back an OK message; perform a POST and then a GET request to obtain that calculation information.
6. In the GET request, append the calculation to the DOM using JQuery.  Have the history of calculations remain intact after refreshing.
